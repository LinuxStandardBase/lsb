LSB Specification Proposal

Problem Statement:
------------------

For administrators and certain types of applications it is important to have
a cross distribution consistent naming policy for system created users. In
certain cases it is also important to have a consistent user and group ids
(UID & GID) for system created users.

The various available cloud frameworks such as OpenStack, openNebula,
CloudStack, and Eucalyptus come to mind. All cloud frameworks have services
running on all the nodes in a cluster that comprises the cloud on the hardware
side. It is generally possible to configure image sharing in these frameworks
via NFS and thus the user name, UID, and GID need to match on all installations
to provide the proper access permissions. This requirement reduces to
consistent user names with NFSv4, but the adoption rate of NFSv4 is unknown.
Additionally services for cloud frameworks may be configured in an HA
environment and may not tolerate fail-over with UID transitioning.

In an environment where LDAP is used system administrators may pre-create
system users through the LDAP mechanism. This is difficult if different
user names and UID as well as GID implementations exist across various
distributions.

Last but not least system users, i.e. names created through distribution
provided packages, may collide with names created for "regular" system
users. A common pattern for user names on Unix systems is to combine
letters of the users name, many combinations of first and last name letters
are in use. This may lead to combinations that may overlap with system user
names. Sharing a user name between a system user and a person user leads
to surprising or even security relevant misbehavior as the daemon user
may write to files in the real user's home or vice versa.

A cross distribution solution will also give upstream projects an avenue to
determine user names when needed and ensure that distributions are consistent
eliminating one potential source of issues for upstream projects


Proposed Solution:
--------------------

The proposal is to adopt a consistent naming an numbering convention across
Linux distributions. The proposed solution is 3 fold to address 3 distinct
problems described in the Problem Statement above.

1.) Consistent grouping of system users, system users are defined as those
    users created by distribution packages.
2.) Create a naming convention for system users
3.) Create prescribed user IDs for specific system users that need to be
    consistent across distributions.

1.) It is proposed to consider using a grouping similar to the existing
Debian numbering policy documented here: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.2.1 . This provides the option of assigning "fixed" UIDs
for those processes that need them in either the range of 1 - 99 (0 being
already allocated for root) or in the 60000 - 64999 range. Although is expected
that only few (famous last words) system users need a consistent UID across
distributions it is probably best to allocate fixed IDs in the 60000 range to
avoid interfereing with existing IDs used by various distributions in the
0-99 range. It should be up to the upstream projects or packagers of
that code to make a case for a static UID/GID.

Some of the current policies:

Debian
------ 
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.2.1

0-99:
  pre-allocated fixed uids
  http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/cjwatson/base-passwd.git;a=blob;f=passwd.master;h=7cd4e24bfcb6f4595dec40524fec5cc2f98fe962;hb=HEAD

100-999:
  dynamically allocated system users

1000-59999:
  user accounts

60000-64999:
  reserved fixed uids, created on demand for 'obscure' packages.
  Registry of user names is here:
  http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/cjwatson/base-passwd.git;a=blob;f=README;h=664277f47e5aec143278d9a3fff3b6c4a7ed4895;hb=HEAD

65000-65533:
  unused 

Fedora
------ 
from
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/shadow-utils.git/tree/shadow-utils.login.defs

0-200:
 reserved fixed uids, most created on demand
 https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/setup.git/tree/passwd
 Registry:
 https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/setup.git/tree/uidgid
 looking at that file it seems they are running out of uids there

201-999:
  dynamically allocated system users

1000-60000:
  user accounts

Gentoo
------
login.defs seems to be unmodified from shadow package

0-100:
  reserved fixed uids (+250 which is hardcoded to portage)
  http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/baselayout/trunk/share.Linux/passwd?revision=3110&view=markup
  Some created on demand but no central registry seems to exist

101-999:
  dynamically allocated system users

1000-60000:
  user accounts

SUSE
----
from /etc/login.defs, pkg shadow

0-99:
  reserved fixed uids, some created on demand by packages but no
  registry for those

100-499:
  dynamically allocated system users

500-999:
  unused

1000-60000:
  user accounts


Thanks to Ludwig Nussel for doing the leg work and collecting this information.
The registry of users could rest with the LSB work group.

2.) We should establish a naming convention for all users created by packages.
The chosen convention should diminish the collision likelihood between users
created by the system administrator, i.e. "real" users and system users. In a
discussion on the openSUSE list it was proposed to prefix system user names
with an "_" (underscore.) This has precedence in openBSD, the proposal for
this prefix and a rationale can be found here:
https://github.com/lnussel/osep_opensuse_usernames/blob/master/opensuse_usernames.txt. Using "_" as a prefix appears to be a reasonable solution
and thus this is nominated as the solution to adopt.

3.) Using fixed UID/GID for certain types of system users across distributions
will allow users to install multiple distributions and use the distribution
provided packages without having to take special care of the creation of
UIDs and GIDs for these users. The primary candidates for cross distribution
consistent UDS and GIDs are the known cloud frame works, CloudStack,
Eucalyptus, openNebula, and OpenStack. All frameworks support storage access
via NFS for image storage or may be setup in a HA environment. While NFSv4
supports different UIDs/GIDs for the same user on different installations, the
penetration of NFSv4 may not be sufficiently high to eliminate this need. In
an HA fail over environment the potential change in UID of the user on one
machine and another UID on the fail over machine may not be tolerated. It is
therefore proposed that the created system users for the cloud frameworks
be assigned consistent user IDs across distributions start with 99 and working
down, the order is not of material interest.

_oneadmin   -> 60001  (system user for openNebula)
_openstack  -> 60002
_cloudstack -> 60003
_eucalyptus -> 60004

Using the proposed "_" prefix for the proposed IDs for the cloud frameworks.
